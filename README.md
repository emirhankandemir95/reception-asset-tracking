# Reception Asset Tracking System (RATS)

**Efficiently manage hotel assets, key cards, and courier deliveries directly from the command line.**

## Project Overview
Working as a receptionist, I identified a recurring issue: **Tracking key cards and equipment given to couriers or temporary staff.** Manual tracking often leads to lost items and confusion during shift changes.

I developed this Python-based automation tool to solve this problem by creating a digital log system that ensures accountability and reduces asset loss.

## Key Features
* **Real-time Tracking:** Instantly record who took which key card/asset.
* **Check-in / Check-out Logic:** Prevent duplicate entries and ensure all items are returned.
* **Data Integrity:** Uses Python Dictionaries for fast lookups and `try-except` blocks for robust error handling.
* **Shift-Friendly:** Simple interface designed for quick usage during busy hotel hours.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Concepts:** Dictionaries, Loops (While/For), Input Validation, Error Handling.

## 🔮 Future Improvements (Roadmap)
* [ ] Exporting daily logs to Excel/CSV for management review.
* [ ] Integrating a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Tkinter.
* [ ] Connecting to a SQLite database for permanent storage.
